Write a program to fill a 5 x 5 grid such that each row (from left to right), each column (from top to bottom) and each diagonal (from left to right) form a 5-digit prime number. The sum of the digits of each prime is the same. For example:

1    1    3    5    1

3    3    2    0    3

3    0    3    2    3

1    4    0    3    3

3    3    3    1    1

Here, the digits of each prime add up to 11. The diagonal primes are 13331 and 34301.

Data consists of two numbers, m and n. The digits of each prime must add up to m and n must be placed in the top-left position. In the example, m = 11 and n = 1.

You may use the same prime more than once in the grid. You must output all possible solutions.

In addition to the above, there are two other solutions for m = 11 and n = 1. They are:

1 1 3 5 1                  1 3 3 1 3

1 4 0 3 3                  1 3 0 4 3

3 0 3 2 3       and        3 2 3 0 3

5 3 2 0 1                  5 0 2 3 1

1 3 3 1 3                  1 3 3 3 1
